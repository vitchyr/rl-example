## Black Jack
BlackJack is an example MDP that gives you an idea of how to implement a
non-trival MDP.

Some simple scripts you can run:
* `test_montecarlo.lua` - See how Monte Carlo Control does on BlackJack and
  TestMdp.
* `test_tablesarsa.lua` - See how Table-Lookup Sarsa Lambda does on BlackJack
  and TestMdp.
* `test_thresholdpolicy.lua` - See how a super simple policy does on BlackJack.

This MDP is based on Easy 21 by Johannes.
